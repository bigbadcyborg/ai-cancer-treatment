/*
    Forward Chaining is a method which builds a decision tree based on facts via user input. It creates a conclusion based on rules and user facts.
        For example, say our decided rule base states that if a and b then c. Now, when the user gives values a and b, the system generates c.

    Our rule base will contain cancer symptoms.
