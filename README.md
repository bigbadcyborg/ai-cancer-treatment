My goal is to develop this ai model in a way that 
i can implement other types of queries such as advice referencing any material e.g. cancer diagnosis, treatments, documentation/researches or The Holy Bible

“In **rule-based AI**, the **fact base** provides input, the **rule base** processes it, and the **knowledge base** contains all necessary relationships.”

[ruleBase](https://github.com/bigbadcyborg/artificial-intelligence/blob/main/variableList.txt) <br>
[knowledgeBase](https://github.com/bigbadcyborg/artificial-intelligence/blob/main/knowledgeBase.txt) will use a Rule Base and and a Fact Base<br>
