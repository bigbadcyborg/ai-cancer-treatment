My goal is to develop this ai model in a way that 
i can implement other types of queries such as advice referencing any material e.g. cancer diagnosis, treatments, documentation/researches, The Holy Bible, and so much more

“In **rule-based AI**, the **fact base** provides input, the **rule base** processes it, and the **knowledge base** contains all necessary relationships.”

[ruleBase](/ai-cancer-treatment/ruleBase) <br>
[knowledgeBase](/ai-cancer-treatment/knowledgeBase) will use a Rule Base and and a Fact Base<br>
